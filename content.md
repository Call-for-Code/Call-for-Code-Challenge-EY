## Datasets

* Make sure to use the correct dataset from [here](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/tree/main/data) for each phase of the challenge as explained in the [leaderboard](http://ibm.biz/cfcsc-wildfires-lead):

  * Phase 1: [Nov_10.zip](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/blob/main/data/Nov_10.zip)
  * Phase 2: to be added
  * Phase 3: to be added

* These [slides](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/blob/main/resources/wildfire-challenge-data-introduction.pdf) and the [data documentation](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/blob/main/data/Readme_Docs_Wildfires-Datasets_2020-11.pdf) contain more info on the data
* This [replay](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/call-for-code-spot-2) and [slides](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/blob/main/resources/call-for-code_wildfire-challenge_slides_30Nov.pdf) explains how the data was aggreagated for the challenge

## Miscellaneous

* This [replay](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/call-for-code-spot) and [notebooks](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/blob/main/notebooks) contains some data explorations
* This [document](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/blob/main/resources/AutoAI_WalkThrough_NSW_Temperature_Data.pdf) provides an example of how to use AutoAI. Find the data needed to follow along [here](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/blob/main/data/misc/NSW_Wildfires_Temperature.csv).
* Download a shape file from [here](https://map.igismap.com/share-map/export-layer/Australia_boundary/13fe9d84310e77f13a6d184dbf1232f3) to create a map of the 7 regions as in [this notebook](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/blob/main/notebooks/EDA_Wildfire%20Prediction_22112020.ipynb)
